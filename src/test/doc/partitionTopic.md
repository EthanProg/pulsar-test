### Apache Pulsar is a distributed messaging and event streaming platform that allows you to publish and consume messages in a scalable and fault-tolerant manner. In Pulsar, the concept of "partitioned topics" is used to scale the number of consumers and producers for a particular topic.

Here are the steps to create partitioned topics in Apache Pulsar:

Create a Partitioned Topic:
To create a partitioned topic, you need to specify the number of partitions when creating the topic. You can do this using the Pulsar Admin CLI or Pulsar Admin REST API.

Using the Pulsar Admin CLI:

```bash
pulsar-admin topics create-partitioned-topic \
persistent://your-tenant/your-namespace/your-topic \
--num-partitions 4
```

This example creates a partitioned topic named your-topic with 4 partitions.

Produce Messages to a Partitioned Topic:
When producing messages to a partitioned topic, you can choose to specify the partition to which the message should be sent. If you don't specify a partition, Pulsar automatically selects one based on the message key using a partitioning function.

Using the Pulsar Producer API in Java:

```java
Producer<String> producer = client.newProducer(Schema.STRING)
.topic("persistent://your-tenant/your-namespace/your-topic")
.create();
producer.send("Message 1");  // Pulsar selects partition based on message key
producer.send("Key1", "Message 2");  // Message sent to a specific partition
```



When consuming messages from a partitioned topic, you need to create a consumer for each partition you want to consume from.

Using the Pulsar Consumer API in Java:

```java
Consumer<String> consumer = client.newConsumer(Schema.STRING)
.subscriptionName("your-subscription")
.subscriptionType(SubscriptionType.Exclusive)
.subscriptionMode(SubscriptionMode.Durable)
.subscribe("persistent://your-tenant/your-namespace/your-topic");

// Consume messages from partition 0
Message<String> msg = consumer.receive();

// Acknowledge the message
consumer.acknowledge(msg);
```

Repeat the consumer creation process for each partition if you want to consume from multiple partitions concurrently.

By using partitioned topics, you can achieve parallelism in message processing and distribute the load among multiple consumers. Keep in mind that the number of partitions should be chosen carefully based on the expected workload and scalability requirements.
