# In pulsar, what's the difference between JSONSchema and Schema.AVRO ?


In Apache Pulsar, JSONSchema and Avro are two different serialization formats for messages, and they serve different use cases. Let's explore the differences between JSONSchema and Avro in the context of Pulsar:

## JSONSchema:

- Format: JSONSchema is a text-based format based on JSON. It defines the structure of the data using a JSON-like syntax.
- Human-Readable: JSONSchema is human-readable, making it easy to understand the data structure just by looking at the schema.
- Dynamic Typing: JSONSchema allows for dynamic typing, meaning that the types of fields can change between messages.
- Flexibility: It is flexible and easy to work with, especially for data that may have evolving schemas over time.
- Examples: JSON, JSON with schema (like JSONSchema.org's specification).
- Example of using JSONSchema with Pulsar:

```java
PulsarClient client = PulsarClient.builder().serviceUrl(serviceUrl).build();
Producer<MyData> producer = client.newProducer(Schema.JSON(MyData.class)).topic(topic).create();
```

##Avro:

- Format: Avro is a binary serialization format that uses a compact binary representation.
- Compact Binary: Avro's binary encoding is more compact compared to JSON, making it more efficient in terms of space.
- Schema Evolution: Avro supports schema evolution, allowing the schema to evolve over time without breaking compatibility with existing data.
- Code Generation: Avro often involves code generation, where classes corresponding to the Avro schema are generated in advance.
- Static Typing: Avro enforces static typing, meaning that the types of fields are fixed and must align with the schema.

Example of using Avro with Pulsar:

```java
PulsarClient client = PulsarClient.builder().serviceUrl(serviceUrl).build();
Producer<MyAvroRecord> producer = client.newProducer(Schema.AVRO(MyAvroRecord.class)).topic(topic).create();
```

Choosing Between JSONSchema and Avro:

- If your data has a well-defined, stable schema, and you prefer a compact binary format for efficiency, Avro might be a good choice.
- If your data has a flexible or evolving schema, and you prefer a human-readable format, JSONSchema could be more suitable.
- Keep in mind that the choice between JSONSchema and Avro often depends on your specific use case, the nature of your data, and the trade-offs between readability, efficiency, and schema evolution.
